    <h3 class="tyagi">What is CSS? </h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><del>CSS is not neccesary</del><mark> CSS saves a alot of work.</mark>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    
    </ol>
    <h3 class="tyagi">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span id = "ui"><mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</mark></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
